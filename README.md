# Hi, I’m Deepika. R | Strategic Data Professional 📊

I bridge the gap between complex datasets and actionable business strategy. As a Data Science graduate specializing in **R** and **SQL**, I focus on transforming raw numbers into clear narratives that drive growth and optimize operations.

### 🚀 Technical Expertise
* **Statistical Programming:** R (Tidyverse, Caret, ggplot2) for Machine Learning & Predictive Modeling.
* **Data Management:** SQL (Advanced querying, Joins, CTEs) for data extraction and structuring.
* **Analytics & BI:** Tableau, Power BI, and Excel for executive-level storytelling.
* **Specialties:** Regression Analysis, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and Market Trend Forecasting.

### 🧪 Featured Strategic Projects
* **[Airplane Price Prediction](https://github.com/Deepika-Rajasekar/Flight-Price-Prediction):** A predictive engine built in R to identify value drivers in the aviation market.
* **[Guvi Sales Performance](https://github.com/Deepika-Rajasekar/Guvi-Sales-Performance-Dashboard):** A Power BI suite focused on identifying regional growth opportunities and sales bottlenecks.
* **Customer Retention Strategy (In Progress):** Leveraging R to predict churn and recommend high-impact retention tactics.

### 📈 Beyond the Code
I believe data is only as valuable as the decisions it inspires. Whether I am building a machine learning model or a business dashboard, my goal is always the same: **Find the "Why" behind the numbers.**
